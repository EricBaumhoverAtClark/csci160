My diagonal difference solution is time complexity O(sqrt(n)) and space complexity O(1).

For time complexity, the algorithm takes in n elements as a square matrix k, where k \* k = n. 
Looping through k elements and doing constant work, it achieves O(k).
k = sqrt(n), so O(sqrt(n)) time complexity.

For space complexity, only two integer variables are stored inside the algorithm not as inputs. They have constant size.
O(1) Space complexity.
